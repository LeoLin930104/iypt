## Bead Dynamics
>	A circular hoop rotates about a vertical diameter. A small bead is allowed to roll in a groove on the inside of the hoop. 
>   Investigate the relevant parameters affecting the dynamics of the bead.  
>   Using Tracker that tracks out the x, y coordinates of ball over time.  
>   Using Python to make analysis of:
> + Magnitude,  
> + Angle,  
> + Rotational Angle,  
> + Theta relative to track.  
> + Use processed data to plot Theta, Angular_Velocity Graph
